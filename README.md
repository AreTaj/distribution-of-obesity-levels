## Project Intro/Objective
The main purpose of this project is to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex factors that contribute to obesity in Latin America. The analysis focuses on using statistical methods, particularly random forest regression, to identify key determinants of obesity, such as body mass index (BMI), body weight, and diet. We hypothesize that specific combinations of lifestyle factors, such as high consumption of processed foods, limited physical activity, and family history of obesity, are significantly correlated with obesity rates. By identifying these patterns, targeted public health interventions can be developed to address individuals at higher risk and promote healthier behaviors.

Through statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, we hypothesize that specific combinations of these variables are significantly correlated with obesity rates. For instance, we anticipate that individuals who consume a high proportion of processed foods, engage in limited physical activity, and have a family history of obesity are more likely to be overweight or obese. By identifying these patterns, targeted public health interventions can be developed to address the specific needs of individuals at risk and promote healthier lifestyles. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex factors that contribute to obesity in Latin America. The findings will inform public health strategies and interventions to combat this growing health crisis and support efforts to improve overall population health.

## Project Description
The source dataset, “Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition”, was created by Fabio Mendoza Palechor and Alexis de la Hoz Manotas in 2019 and obtained from the UCI Irvine Machine Learning Repository. It has 16 features, 2111 instances, and a class variable NObesity (Obesity Level) that allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III. 

Data cleaning & preparation and exploratory data analysis were performed in Python to facilitate model selection and model analysis. A random forest model was constructed and provided accurate predictions and highlighted relationships between predictors and obesity levels.
